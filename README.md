# 3d-Printer-Temperature-Controller
3d printer temperature controller for the heated bed

# About
the 3d printer is a device that can manufacture any 3d model into a real plastic parts
in order to do that the printer uses filament of plastics pass it through heaters, and extrudes it while moving in xy axis to make layer of plastic
and then move up on z-axis to lay out the other layers to form a 3d model, but for the 3d model to stick to the surface while printing it needs a heated bed

# This Project
in this project, I designed a firmware to control the heatedbed to maintain a proper temperature while printing various types of plastics
as each type requires different temperature
